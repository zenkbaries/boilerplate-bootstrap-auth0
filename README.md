# React Boilerplate

This is a React app boilerplate with Auth0.

Feel free to use this boilerplate.  To use it, clone this repository and then complete all items in the [What's Next](#whats-next) section. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

[Auth0](https://auth0.com/) is a flexible, drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to your applications. 
Read this guide, ["React:Login"](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react), to understand how it was implemented and to better understand it. Use it as a guide to help you customize your app.

# What's next:

- [ ] Change README contents - replace the contents of each section with the specifics of your app
- [ ] Update package.json
  - [ ] name
  - [ ] description
  - [ ] main
  - [ ] keywords 
  - [ ] repository
  - [ ] author
  - [ ] license
- [ ] Add your Domain and ClientID to `auth_config.json`. from your Auth0 account. 
- [ ] Customize App.css
- [ ] Customize Profile.js 
- [ ] Customize NavBar.js
- [ ] Remove this section of the README, you're set

Note: The following file is not needed but it is there so you can see how the Auth0 can be used. It can be deleleted or replaced with something else and not interfer with Auth0 code setup:
* `Profile.js`
* `NavBar.js`

# This is a pre-release!

This is a quick first draft. All the options that will likely need to be added to accommodate a large
number of use-cases are still needed. If you'd like to make requests or help update this boilerplate, please
